# bootstrap-commander #

The worst framework that want to be the best.
If the weel was not been reinvented, it would have remained in stone.

## Philosophy ##

bootstrap-commander is a javascript application framework to build web applications, rather graphic than theory. 

1.  All graphic elements (inputs, combobox, calendar picker, etc...) in one place
2.  MVC ok, but not too much... practice before all, minimize number of files
1.  The classical objects oriented programming is not usual in other javascript framework nowadays... what a pity... 
1.  No theory about binding which represents a little part of the application, a simple function to fill the form is enought and easily comprehensible
1.  A big place for jQuery, but not use the plugins principle... OOP is better
2.  for now, concentrate about client side... use PHP or NodeJs or Rails as you like... I love Node.js after 15 years to go with PHP
3.  Use jQuery, Bootstrap, Mustache.js because the simplest and minimalist frameworks... and work well together... with bootstrap-commander.
4.  very small size
